## About
All the graphical components in this game were created using functions from the raylib library; no images or textures were utilized. <br>
The CPU movement pattern was implemented using a self-made random algorithm system. The primary movement is always upwards unless it encounters a dead end. <br> When passing through an intersection or facing a possible new direction, it has a 60% chance of continuing forward and a 40% chance of turning left or right.
